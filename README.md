# Augmented Magics
Mod made to improve how successful non-damaging spells are on higher difficult.

Specifically this mod adds a 3rd teir of "Spell Focus" which requires "Greater Spell Focus" as a prerequisite feat. Some of these may feel/be quite broken, and have absolutely no basis in tabletop. They are simply an attempt to alleviate the tendancy of enemies have inflated save bonuses on higher difficulties for spell schools heavily reliant on DC passes, while also addressing the relative uselessness of ever picking Spell Focus Abjuration for example.

Augmented Abjuration - Abjurations you cast now last 24 hours and ignore spell resistance.

Augmented Conjuration - Conjuration spells you cast ignore spell resistance. Conjuration spells now are Selective and have a higher DC based on your Constitution bonus.

Augmented Divination - Divination spells you cast ignore spell resistance. Divination spells are not consumed when cast, but still must be prepared if required.

Augmented Enchantment - Your enchantments now have a higher DC based on your Charisma bonus and ignore spell resistance.

Augmented Evocation - Evocation spells you cast now deal bonus damage per impact.

Augmented Illusion - Your illusions now have a higher DC based on your Intelligence bonus and ignore spell resistance.

Augmented Necromancy - Your Necromancy spells now have a higher DC based on your Strength bonus and ignore spell resistance.

Augmented Transmutation - Transmutation spells you cast ignore spell resistance. Transmutation spells now automatically are Extended and have a higher DC.

**Thanks**

Vek17 and their Tabletop Tweaks mod, couldn't understand how to actually do some of this stuff I couldn't dissect and take apart how your mod worked. 

RealityMachina and their Scaling Cantrips mod, for much the same reason.
